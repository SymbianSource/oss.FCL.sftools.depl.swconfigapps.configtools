					==================================================================
					Welcome to use S60 Configuration Tool (CT) for 3.X & 5.X platforms 
					==================================================================

S60 Configuration Tool is a PC software that is used to configure S60 build environment. This tool is targeted to variant or integration
engineers to ease their manual work when creating variant content (i.e. updating default/changed values for CenRep keys in TXT files, creating IBY files etc) 
and creating confml, crml files.
See http://delivery.nmp.nokia.com/trac/configurationtool/wiki/ for more information.


IMPORTANT NOTICE:

Version 2.2.0 of the S60 Configuration Tool introduces validation feature that can cause unexpected validation error messages during generation. 
For more information about validation, see http://s60wiki.nokia.com/S60Wiki/Configuration_Tool_Validation
