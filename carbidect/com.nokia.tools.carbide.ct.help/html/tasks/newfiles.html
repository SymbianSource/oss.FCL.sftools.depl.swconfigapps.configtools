         For creating different types of files there are wizards in the tool to ease the job. There are two main wizards: wizard for creating ConfML files and wizard for creatin ImplML files. 
         The ConfML wizard is able to create ConfML files with initial content. The ImplML wizard is able to create all kinds of other ML files, which are supported, including .crml, .gcfml, .hcrml, .implml, .ruleml, .content, and more.
         To create new files with wizards follow these steps:
		 <ol>
		 <li>Right-click the folder where you want to create the file (usually confml folder in the layer).</li>
		 <li>Select <b>New</b>.</li>
		 <li>From the popup menu choose either <b>Configuration File</b> or <b>ImplML file</b></li>
		 <li>Let the wizard guide you the rest of creating the new file</li>
		 </ol>
